## Redis.io

This app needs a Redis.io server running on your local machine with default settings (no need to edit redis.conf).

For example porposes you can download an easy to setup version of Redis.io for Windows 10 on:

https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads (version 2.4.5)

After extracting the files you only need to execute and keep running [install_folder]/64bit/redis-server.exe

For checking realtime data on the Redis.io server you can run [install_folder]/64bit/redis-cli.exe and execute commands with reference to https://redis.io/commands
